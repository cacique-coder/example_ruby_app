This it's a example project that I have worked. Features

- CSV uploader, load data in background (CSV)
- API
- Differents user types
- Tell don't ask 
- Using yaml_db to simulate a new project rails migrating the database. For obviously reasons the file database.yml was deleted

  ```
  rake db:test:prepare
  rspec
  ```
